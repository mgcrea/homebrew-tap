# The source of truth for the cask. It does not live here to be installed from —
# Homebrew reads casks out of a tap — but so that the version and sha256 are
# bumped by the same CI job that produced the artifact they describe, rather than
# by hand in another repository afterwards. The `release-app` job renders this
# file and pushes it to mgcrea/homebrew-tap as Casks/cupertino.rb.
#
# The two placeholders below are substituted by that job from the artifact it
# just built and checksummed.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Cupertino needs Full Disk Access. Grant it in
    System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access.

    Two things `brew uninstall --zap` cannot remove, because no unprivileged
    process is allowed to:

      * the Full Disk Access grant itself. To clear it:
          sudo tccutil reset SystemPolicyAllFiles io.mgcrea.cupertino

      * the login item, if you enabled it. Turn it off in Cupertino's settings
        before uninstalling, or clear it later in
        System Settings > General > Login Items.

    MCP client configs that Cupertino wrote hold an absolute path to
    Contents/Helpers/cupertino-bridge, and uninstalling does not revisit them.
